Hey, I'm ZADY — a 2006-born Romanian creative freelancer, active in graphic design, photo/video editing, photography, and whatever else sparks my curiosity along the way.
I’ve collaborated with clients worldwide: from major festivals like Rolling Loud to local venues, musicians, event organizers, YouTubers, and brands.
My work is fueled by a love for all things artistic and the creative process itself, with fashion and music not just as interests, but as the core inspiration behind my entire vision.
